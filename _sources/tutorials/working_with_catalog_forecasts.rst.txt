Working with catalog-based forecasts
====================================

This example shows some basic interactions with data-based forecasts. We will load in a forecast stored in the CSEP
data format, and compute the expected rates on a 0.1° x 0.1° grid covering the state of California. We will plot the
expected rates in the spatial cells.

Overview:
    1. Define forecast properties (time horizon, spatial region, etc).
    2. Compute the expected rates in space and magnitude bins
    3. Plot expected rates in the spatial cells

Load required libraries
-----------------------

Most of the core functionality can be imported from the top-level :mod:`csep` package. Utilities are available from the
:mod:`csep.utils` subpackage.

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy

    import csep
    from csep.core import regions
    from csep.utils import datasets

Load data forecast
---------------------

PyCSEP contains some basic forecasts that can be used to test of the functionality of the package. This forecast has already 
been filtered to the California RELM region.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-37

.. code-block:: Python


    forecast = csep.load_catalog_forecast(datasets.ucerf3_ascii_format_landers_fname)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-45

Define spatial and magnitude regions
------------------------------------

Before we can compute the bin-wise rates we need to define a spatial region and a set of magnitude bin edges. The magnitude
bin edges # are the lower bound (inclusive) except for the last bin, which is treated as extending to infinity. We can
bind these # to the forecast object. This can also be done by passing them as keyword arguments
into :func:`csep.load_catalog_forecast`.

.. code-block:: Python


    # Magnitude bins properties
    min_mw = 4.95
    max_mw = 8.95
    dmw = 0.1

    # Create space and magnitude regions
    magnitudes = regions.magnitude_bins(min_mw, max_mw, dmw)
    region = regions.california_relm_region()

    # Bind region information to the forecast (this will be used for binning of the catalogs)
    forecast.region = regions.create_space_magnitude_region(region, magnitudes)

Compute spatial event counts
----------------------------

The :class:`csep.core.forecasts.CatalogForecast` provides a method to compute the expected number of events in spatial cells. This 
requires a region with magnitude information.

Plot expected event counts
--------------------------

We can plot the expected event counts the same way that we plot a :class:`csep.core.forecasts.GriddedForecast`

.. code-block:: Python


    ax = forecast.expected_rates.plot(plot_args={'clim': [-3.5, 0]}, show=True)

The images holes in the image are due to under-sampling from the forecast.

Quick sanity check
------------------

The forecasts were filtered to the spatial region so all events should be binned. We loop through each data in the forecast and
count the number of events and compare that with the expected rates. The expected rate is an average in each space-magnitude bin, so
we have to multiply this value by the number of catalogs in the forecast.

    total_events = 0
    for catalog in forecast:
        total_events += catalog.event_count
    numpy.testing.assert_allclose(total_events, forecast.expected_rates.sum() * forecast.n_cat)
