Plotting gridded forecast
=========================

This example show you how to load a gridded forecast stored in the default ASCII format.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-14

Load required libraries
-----------------------

Most of the core functionality can be imported from the top-level :mod:`csep` package. Utilities are available from the
:mod:`csep.utils` subpackage.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-18

.. code-block:: Python


    import csep
    from csep.utils import datasets, time_utils








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-25

Define forecast properties
--------------------------

We choose a :ref:`time-independent-forecast` to show how to evaluate a grid-based earthquake forecast using PyCSEP. Note,
the start and end date should be chosen based on the creation of the forecast. This is important for time-independent forecasts
because they can be rescale to any arbitrary time period.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-29

.. code-block:: Python


    start_date = time_utils.strptime_to_utc_datetime('2006-11-12 00:00:00.0')
    end_date = time_utils.strptime_to_utc_datetime('2011-11-12 00:00:00.0')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-35

Load forecast
-------------

For this example, we provide the example forecast data set along with the main repository. The filepath is relative
to the root directory of the package. You can specify any file location for your forecasts.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-41

.. code-block:: Python


    forecast = csep.load_gridded_forecast(datasets.helmstetter_mainshock_fname,
                                          start_date=start_date,
                                          end_date=end_date,
                                          name='helmstetter_mainshock')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-47

Plot forecast
-------------

The forecast object provides :meth:`csep.core.forecasts.GriddedForecast.plot` to plot a gridded forecast. This function
returns a matplotlib axes, so more specific attributes can be set on the figure.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-50

.. code-block:: Python


    ax = forecast.plot(show=True)
