        Counties. Severe damage occurred in the San Fernando\nValley: maximum intensities
        of (IX) were observed in and near\nNorthridge and in Sherman Oaks. Lesser,
        but still significant\ndamage occurred at Fillmore, Glendale, Santa Clarita,
        Santa\nMonica, Simi Valley and in western and central Los Angeles.\nDamage
        was also sustained to Anaheim Stadium. Collapsed\noverpasses closed sections
        of the Santa Monica Freeway, the\nAntelope Valley Freeway, the Simi Valley
        Freeway and the Golden\nState Freeway. Fires caused additional damage in the
        San\nFernando Valley and at Malibu and Venice. Preliminary estimates\nof damage
        are between 13 and 20 billion U.S. dollars. Felt\nthroughout much of southern
        California and as far away as\nTurlock, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Richfield,
        Utah and\nEnsenada, Mexico. The maximum recorded acceleration exceeded\n1.0g
        at several sites in the area with the largest value of\n1.8g recorded at Tarzana,
        about 7 km south of the epicenter. A\nmaximum uplift of about 15 cm occurred
        in the Santa Susana\nMountains and many rockslides occurred in mountain areas,\nblocking
        some roads. Some ground cracks were observed at\nGranada Hills and in Potrero

        Summary</h2>\n<p>\nThe March 11, 2011, M 9.1 Tohoku earthquake, which occurred
        near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, resulted from shallow thrust faulting
        on the subduction zone plate boundary between the Pacific and\u00a0North America\u00a0plates.
        At the location of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves roughly westward
        relative to the North America plate at a velocity of 83 mm/yr, and begins
        its westward descent beneath Japan at the Japan Trench, east of the March
        11th earthquake. Note that some authors divide this region into several microplates
        that together define the relative motions between the larger Pacific, North
        America and Eurasia plates; these include the Okhotsk and Amur microplates
        that are part of North America and Eurasia, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe
        location, depth (about 25 km), and focal mechanism solutions of the March
        11th earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred on the subduction
        zone plate boundary. Modeling of the rupture of this earthquake indicates
        that the fault moved as much as 50\u201360 m, and slipped over an area approximately
        400 km long (along strike) by 150 km wide (in the down-dip direction). The\u00a0rupture
        zone\u00a0is roughly centered on the earthquake epicenter along strike, while
        peak slips were up-dip of the hypocenter, towards the Japan Trench axis. The
        March 11th earthquake was preceded by a series of large foreshocks over the
        previous 2 days, beginning on March 9 with a M 7.4 event approximately 40
        km from the epicenter of the March 11th earthquake, and continuing with another
        three earthquakes greater than M 6 on the same day.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Japan
        Trench subduction zone has hosted nine events of M 7+ since 1973. The largest
        of these, a M 7.8 earthquake approximately 260 km to the north of the March
        11th epicenter, caused 3 fatalities and almost 700 injuries in December 1994.
        In June 1978, a M 7.7 earthquake 35 km to the southwest of the March 11th
        epicenter caused 22 fatalities and more than 400 injuries. Large offshore
        earthquakes have occurred in the same subduction zone in 1611, 1896, and 1933
        that each produced devastating tsunami waves on the Sanriku Coast of Pacific
        northeast Japan. That coastline is particularly vulnerable to tsunami waves
        because it has many deep coastal embayments that amplify tsunami waves and
        cause great wave inundations. The M 7.6 subduction earthquake of 1896 created
        tsunami waves as high 38 m and caused 27,000 fatalities. The M 8.6 earthquake
        of March 2, 1933, produced tsunami waves as high as 29 m on the Sanriku Coast
        and caused more than 3,000 fatalities. Unlike the recent M 9.0 earthquake,
        the 1933 earthquake did not occur as the result of thrust faulting on the
        subduction zone plate interface, but rather within the Pacific plate just
        seaward of the Japan Trench.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe March 11, 2011, earthquake was
        much larger than other post-1900 plate boundary thrust fault earthquakes in
        the southern Japan Trench, none of which attained M 8. A similarly sized predecessor
        may have occurred on July 13, 869, when the Sendai area was swept by a large
        tsunami that Japanese scientists have identified from written records and
        a sand sheet.\n</p>\n<p>\nContinuing readjustments of stress and related aftershocks
        are expected in the region of this earthquake. The exact location and timing
        of future aftershocks cannot be specified. Numbers of aftershocks will continue
        to be highest on and near to fault-segments on which rupture occurred at the
        time of the mainshock. The frequency of aftershocks will tend to decrease
        with elapsed time from the time of the mainshock, but the general decrease
        of activity may be punctuated by episodes of higher aftershock activity. Beyond
        the ongoing aftershock sequence, the earthquakes in Japan have not significantly
        raised the probability of future major earthquakes. While the probability
        of future large earthquakes far from northern Honshu has not increased, neither
        has it decreased; large global earthquakes will likely continue to occur just
        as we have observed in the past.\n</p>\n<p>\nHayes et al. (2016) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20161192\">Tectonic

        match selection criteria and whose equivalent EHB or NEIC locations lie within
        the maroon box from Figure 1. Gold CMTs are mechanisms from the gCMT data
        plotted at their equivalent EHB data location, used to constrain trench
        strike and dip. Orange CMTs are mechanisms without EHB locations, placed instead
        at the equivalent event location in the NEIC data, and also used to constrain
        geometry. Light and dark gray circles are events from the EHB data in front
        and behind the plane of the cross-section, respectively, but not used to constrain
        geometry because either (i) they did not have a corresponding mechanism in
        the gCMT data, or (ii) their mechanism in the gCMT data did not match
        selection criteria. The trench location is marked with a red square. Probability
        density functions for EHB and NEIC locations are shown as green lines, scaled
        by a factor of x20 for display purposes. The black solid line describes the
        best fitting planar geometry; the red dashed line the best-fitting non-planar
        geometry. The initial locations of the ''new event'' used to help constrain
        geometry are shown by black circles and marked with arrows corresponding to
        the gCMT epicentroid and NEIC epicenter. PDFs for these locations are shown
        in red. The best-fitting fault plane from the gCMT data for the new event
        (if available) is shown with a black dashed line. By clicking on this figure,
        an expanded cross-section will show the fit between the non-planar geometry
        and deeper earthquake data (maroon circles), also used to help constrain this
        geometry. On this section, gray lines represent 100 bootstrapped interfaces

        of subduction zone showing the area of the trench constrained in this example.
        Earthquake locations from the gCMT data and EHB data (gray circles,
        sized according to magnitude) are shown. Maroon rectangle indicates the area
        shown in cross section (c); all earthquakes within this area may be used to
        constrain trench geometry.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>\nA key step
        in many earthquake source inversions requires knowledge of the geometry of
        the fault on which the earthquake occurred. Our knowledge of this surface
        is often uncertain, however, and as a result fault geometry mislocation can
        map into significant error in the final temporal and spatial slip patterns
        of these inversions. Relying solely on an initial hypocenter and CMT mechanism
        can be risky when establishing rupture characteristics needed for rapid tsunami
        and ground shaking estimates.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere we attempt to improve the quality
        of fast finite-fault inversion results by combining several independent and
        complementary datasets to more accurately constrain the geometry of the seismic
        rupture plane of subducting slabs. Unlike previous analyses aimed at defining
        the general form of the plate interface, we require mechanisms and locations
        of the seismicity considered in our inversions to be consistent with their
        occurrence on the plate interface, by limiting events to those with well-constrained
        depths and with CMT solutions indicative of shallow-dip thrust faulting. We
        construct probability density functions about each location based on formal
        assumptions of their depth uncertainty and use these constraints to solve
        for the ''most likely'' fault plane.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the case of large events
        (M > ~7.5), these planes can be used directly in new finite fault inversions.
        For smaller events, this method provides a quick analysis of the tectonic
        setting of an event and a ''most likely'' depth assuming the earthquake occurred
        on the subduction interface, which can be used as a check against other depth
        estimates produced at the NEIC.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Data Filtering and Inversion</h3>\n<p>\nWe
        filter the historic gCMT data to include only shallow thrust mechanisms
        within 250km of the main shock. We construct the reference profile by calculating
        the average strike of remaining CMTs deeper than the upper plate, projecting
        a line 250km downdip from the trench location nearest to the main shock. We
        remove events greater than 100km distance from the profile in a perpendicular
        direction. We retain the most accurate hypocenter of each event from a heirarcy
        of catalogs, first considering the EHB data (Engdahl et al., 1998), then
        the NEIC PDE, and finally the location in the gCMT data if neither of these
        exist. Next we construct probability density functions about the reported
        depth of the event in the chosen data, whose variance reflects the vertical
        uncertainty of the location. Finally, we calculate the Most Likely Interface
        Geometry following maximum likelihood (for planar fits) and Hermite Spline
        (for non-planar fits) approaches, fitting a line through the trench location
        and the PDFs. The planr solution corresponds to the maximum probability over
        a range of dips from 0-60 degrees; the non-planar solution varies in dip to
        match earthquake data in the seismogenic zone, deeper slab earthquakes, and
        shallow local data where available.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Most Likely Geometry:
        Strike = 194.89, Dip = 14.94</strong></p>\n\n<figure class=\"left\">\n  <img

        of subduction zone taken perpendicular to the average strike of gCMTs that
        match selection criteria and whose equivalent EHB or NEIC locations lie within
        the maroon box from Figure 1. Gold CMTs are mechanisms from the gCMT data
        plotted at their equivalent EHB data location, used to constrain trench
        strike and dip. Orange CMTs are mechanisms without EHB locations, placed instead
        at the equivalent event location in the NEIC data, and also used to constrain
        geometry. Light and dark gray circles are events from the EHB data in front
        and behind the plane of the cross-section, respectively, but not used to constrain
        geometry because either (i) they did not have a corresponding mechanism in
        the gCMT data, or (ii) their mechanism in the gCMT data did not match
        selection criteria. The trench location is marked with a red square. Probability
        density functions for EHB and NEIC locations are shown as green lines, scaled
        by a factor of x20 for display purposes. The black solid line describes the
        best fitting planar geometry; the red dashed line the best-fitting non-planar
        geometry. The initial locations of the ''new event'' used to help constrain
        geometry are shown by black circles and marked with arrows corresponding to
        the gCMT epicentroid and NEIC epicenter. PDFs for these locations are shown
        in red. The best-fitting fault plane from the gCMT data for the new event
        (if available) is shown with a black dashed line. By clicking on this figure,
        an expanded cross-section will show the fit between the non-planar geometry
        and deeper earthquake data (maroon circles), also used to help constrain this
        geometry. On this section, gray lines represent 100 bootstrapped interfaces
