        Summary</h2>\n<p>\nThe September 19, 2017, M 7.1 earthquake in Central Mexico
        occurred as the result of normal faulting at a depth of approximately 50 km.
        Focal mechanism solutions indicate that the earthquake occurred on a moderately
        dipping fault, striking either to the southeast, or to the northwest. The
        event is near, but not directly on, the plate boundary between the Cocos and
        North America plates in the region. At the location of this event, the Cocos
        plate converges with North America at a rate of approximately 76 mm/yr, in
        a northeast direction. The Cocos plate begins its subduction beneath Central
        America at the Middle America Trench, about 300 km to the southwest of this
        earthquake.\u00a0The location, depth, and normal-faulting mechanism of this
        earthquake indicate that it is likely an intraplate event, within the subducting
        Cocos slab, rather than on the shallower megathrust plate boundary interface.\n</p>\n<img
        src=\"mex_09.19.17_simple.jpg\" />\n<p>\nWhile commonly plotted as points
        on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip
        over a larger fault area. Normal-faulting events of the size of the September
        19th, 2017 earthquake are typically about 50x20 km (length x width).\n</p><p>\nOver
        the preceding century, the region within 250 km of the hypocenter of the September
        19th, 2017 earthquake has experienced 19 other M 6.5+ earthquakes. Most occurred
        near the subduction zone interface at the Pacific coast, to the south of the
        September 19 event. The largest was a M 7.6 earthquake in July 1957, in the
        Guerrero region, which caused between to 50-160 fatalities, and many more
        injuries. In June 1999, a M 7.0 at 70 km depth, just to the southeast of the
        September 19, 2017 earthquake, caused 14 fatalities, around 200 injuries,
        and considerable damage in the city of Puebla (MMI VIII).\n</p><p>\nThis earthquake
        occurred on the anniversary of the devastating 1985 M 8.0 Michoacan earthquake,
        which caused extensive damage to Mexico City and the surrounding region. That
        event occurred as the result of thrust faulting on the plate interface between
        the Cocos and North America plates, about 450 km to the west of the September
        19, 2017 earthquake. Today\u2019s earthquake also occurs 12 days after a M
        8.1 earthquake offshore of Chiapas, in southern Mexico. The epicenter of the
        M 8.1 event is located about 650 km to the southeast of today''s quake. That
        earthquake also occurred as the result of normal faulting within the subducting
        Cocos Plate, at a depth of 50-70 km.   \n</p><p>\nAs of September 22nd, USGS
        has not detected any aftershocks for this earthquake. However, <a href=\"http://www.ssn.unam.mx/sismicidad/ultimos/\">
        Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM)</a> has reported
        several aftershocks of M 4 and below using data from their dense regional
        seismic network. This low-rate of aftershocks in not typical for earthquakes
        of this size but has been observed for other intraplate earthquakes, such
