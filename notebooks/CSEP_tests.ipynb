    "### Consistency tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency tests evaluate the consistency of a forecast against observed earthquakes. These tests were developed across a range of experiments and publications (Schorlemmer et al, 2007; Zechar et al 2010; Werner et al, 2011a). The consistency tests are based on the likelihood of observing the catalogue (actual recorded events) given the forecast. Since the space-magnitude bins are assumed to be independent, the joint-likelihood of observing the events in each individual bin given the specified forecast can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pr(\\omega_1 | \\lambda_1) Pr(\\omega_2 | \\lambda_2)...Pr(\\omega_n | \\lambda_n) = \\prod_{m_i , s_j \\in \\boldsymbol{R}} f_{m_i, s_j}(\\omega(m_i, s_j)),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{m_i, s_j}$ specifies the probability distribution in each space-magnitude bin. We prefer to use the joint log-likelihood in order to sum log-likelihoods rather than multiply the likelihoods. The joint log-likelihood can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} | \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) = \\sum_{m_i , s_j \\in \\boldsymbol{R}} log(f_{m_i, s_j}(\\omega(m_i, s_j)). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood of the observations, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$, given the forecast $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$ is the sum over all space-magnitude bins of the log probabilities in individual cells of the forecast. Grid-based forecasts are specified by the expected number of events in a discrete space-magnitude bin. From the maximum entropy principle, we assign a Poisson distribution in each bin. In this case, the probability of an event occurring is independent of the time since the last event, and events occur at a rate $\\lambda$. The Poissonian joint log-likelihood can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} | \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) = \\sum_{m_i , s_j \\in \\boldsymbol{R}} -\\lambda(m_i, s_j) + \\omega(m_i, s_j)\\log(\\lambda(m_i, s_j)) - log(\\omega(m_i, s_j)!), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda(m_i, s_j)$ and $\\omega(m_i, s_j)$ are the expected counts from the forecast and observed counts in cell $m_i, s_j$ respectively. We can calculate the likelihood directly given the forecast and discretised observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary consistency tests\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the Poisson distribution insufficiently captures the variability of earthquakes, as it could be dispersed with respect to the true distribution of seismicity, especially in the presence of clustered earthquakes (Werner and Sornette, 2008; Lombardi and Marzocchi, 2010; Nandan et al., 2019). Therefore, CSEP has recently introduced a set of new consistency tests based on the negative binomial distribution (NBD) and a binary likelihood function, with the aim of reducing the sensitivity of traditional Poisson-based tests to clustering (Bayona et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBD has been shown to better describe non-declustered seismicity, because it has a greater variance than the Poisson distribution to account for spatiotemporal earthquake clustering (Werner et al., 2011a,b). Hence, one can fit a NBD to the rates of observed earthquakes in each forecast's testing region to evaluate number consistencies between forecasts and observations. The probability mass function of an NBD is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P (\\omega\\hspace{0.1cm}|\\hspace{0.1cm}\\tau, \\nu) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\tau + \\omega)}{\\Gamma(\\tau)\\omega!} \\nu^\\omega (1-\\nu)^{\\omega},$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega = 0,1,2,...$ is the number of events, $\\tau > 0$ and $0 \\leq \\nu \\leq 1$ are parameters, and $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function. The mean $\\mu$ and  variance $\\sigma^2$ of the NBD are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu = \\tau\\frac{1 - \\nu}{\\nu}; \\hspace{0.1cm} \\sigma^2=\\tau \\frac{1 - \\nu}{\\nu^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the approach by Werner et al. (2011b), one can use the expected number earthquakes by the forecast as the mean and estimate the variance from historical catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary likelihood function can also make the assumption that earthquakes are Poisson distributed less critical by calculating the probability of observing one or more earthquakes in a forecast cell/bin, rather than the likelihood of observing $\\omega =$ 1,2, .., n events. The probability of observing $\\omega = $ 0 earthquakes given an expected number/rate $\\lambda$, assuming a Poisson distribution, is P$_\\mathrm{0}$ = exp(-$\\lambda)$, while the probability of observing one or more events is P$_\\mathrm{_1}$ = 1 - P$_\\mathrm{0}$ = 1 - exp($-\\lambda)$. Accordingly, one can compute the log-likelihood score in each cell/bin based on the binary (or Bernoulli) distribution as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} | \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}) = X(m_i, s_j) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{P_1} + (1 -X(m_i, s_j)) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{P_0} = X(m_i, s_j) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} (1-\\mathrm{exp}(-\\lambda(m_i, s_j))) + (1 -X_i) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} (\\mathrm{exp}(-\\lambda(m_i, s_j)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term represents the contribution to the score if a bin $(m_i, s_j)$ contains one or more events, i.e. $X(m_i, s_j)$ = 1, and the second term is the contribution if that cell/bin contains no earthquakes, i.e. $X(m_i, s_j)$ = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the example above, the joint likelihood of observing events in individual bins, based on the binary likelihood function, is the sum of each individual log score, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} | \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda})  = \\sum_{m_i , s_j \\in \\boldsymbol{R}} \\hspace{0.05cm}[X(m_i, s_j) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} (1-\\mathrm{exp}(-\\lambda(m_i, s_j))) + (1 - X(m_i, s_j)) \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{log} \\hspace{0.1cm} (\\mathrm{exp}(-\\lambda(m_i, s_j)))]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Forecast uncertainty </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation based approach is used to account for uncertainty in the forecast. We simulate realizations of catalogs that are consistent with the forecast to obtain distributions of scores. In the pyCSEP package, as in the original CSEP tests, simulation is carried out using the cumulative probability density of the forecast obtained by ordering the rates in each bin. We shall call $F_{m_is_j}$ the cumulative probability density in cell $(m_i, s_j)$. The simulation approach then works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each forecast bin, draw a random number $z$ from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1\n",
    "* Assign this event to a space-magnitude bin through the inverse cumulative density distribution at this point $F^{-1}_{m_i, s_j}(z)$\n",
    "* Iterate over all simulated events to generate a catalog containing $N_{sim}$ events consistent with the forecast\n",
    "* In the case of binary tests, simulate catalogs that are consistent with the number of active cells/bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these tests, we can plot the distribution of likelihoods computed from theses simulated catalogs relative to the observations using the `plots.plot_poisson_consistency_test` function. We also calculate a quantile score to diagnose a particular forecast with repsect. The number of simulations can be supplied to the Poisson consistency test functions using the `num_simulations` argument: for best results we suggest 100,000 simulations to ensure convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Scoring the tests </b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Through simulation (as described above), we obtain a set of simulated catalogs $\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}\\}$. Each catalogue can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}_x =\\{ \\hat{\\lambda}_x(m_i, s_j)|(m_i, s_j) \\in \\boldsymbol{R}\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\hat{\\lambda}_x(m_i, s_j)$ is the number of simulated earthquakes in cell $(m_i, s_j)$ of (simulated) catalog $x$ that is consistent with the forecast $\\Lambda$. We then compute the joint log-likelihood for each simulated catalogue $\\hat{L}_x = L(\\hat{\\Omega}_x|\\Lambda)$. The joint log-likelihood for each simulated catalogue given the forecast gives us a set of log-likelihoods $\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{L}}\\}$ that represents the range of log-likelihoods consistent with the forecast. We then compare our simulated log-likelihoods with the observed log-likelihood $L_{obs} = L(\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}|\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda})$ using a quantile score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantile score is defined by the fraction of simulated joint log-likelihoods less than or equal to the observed likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = \\frac{ |\\{ \\hat{L}_x | \\hat{L}_x \\le L_{obs}\\} |}{|\\{ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{L}} \\}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a forecast can be said to pass an evaluation depends on the significance level chosen for the testing process. The quantile score explicitly tells us something about the significance of the result: the observation is consistent with the forecast with $100(1-\\gamma)\\%$ confidence (Zechar, 2011). Low $\\gamma$ values demonstrate that the observed likelihood score is less than most of the simulated catalogs. The consistency tests, excluding the N-test, are considered to be one-sided tests: values which are too small are ruled inconsistent with the forecast, but very large values may not necessarily be inconsistent with the forecast and additional testing should be used to further clarify this (Schorlemmer et al, 2007). \n",
    "\n",
    "Different CSEP experiments have used different sensitivity values. Schorlemmer et al (2010b) consider $\\gamma \\lt 0.05$ while the implementation in the Italian CSEP testing experiment uses $\\gamma$ < 0.01 (Taroni et al, 2018). However, the consistency tests are most useful as diagnostic tools where the quantile score assesses the level of consistency between observations and data. Temporal variations in seismicity make it difficult to formally reject a model from a consistency test over a single evaluation period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Performing multiple tests among samples of the same distribution increases the probability of observing at least one rare events, and consequently, increases the probability of obtaining an apparently statistically significant result (Kato, 2019). Therefore, CSEP has recently included consistency test results at a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level $\\gamma_{B}$ = 0.05 /2 = 0.025 to control the overall type II error rate, that is, the false-positive rate or the \"false-inconsistency\" rate (see Bayona et al., 2022)."

    "    \n",
    "<b>Method:</b> The L-test is one of the original forecast tests described in Schorlemmer et al, 2007. The likelihood of the observation given the model is described by a Poisson likelihood function in each cell and the total joint likelihood described by the product over all bins, or the sum of the log-likelihoods (see above, or Zechar 2011 for more details). \n",

This causes issues in scoring forecasts where the expected number of events are different from the observed number of events. We suggest to use the N-test (below) and CL-test (below) independently to score the rate component, and spatial-magnitude components of the forecast. This behavior can be observed by comparing the CL-test and N-test results with the L-test results in this notebook. Since the forecast overpredicts the rate of events during this testing period, the L-test provides a passing score even though the space-magnitude and rate components perform poorly during this evaluation period.\n",

    "#### <b> CL-test </b>\n",
    "<b>Aim</b>: The original likelihood test described above gives a result that combines the spatial, magnitude and number components of a forecast. The conditional likelihood or CL-Test was developed to test the spatial and magnitude performance of a forecast without the influence of the number of events (Werner et al. 2011a, 2011b). By conditioning the test distribution on the observed number of events we elimiate the dependency with the forecasted number of events as described above.\n",

    "#### <b>N-test</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Aim</b>: The number or N-test is the most conceptually simple test of a forecast: To test whether the number of observed events is consistent with that of the forecast.\n",

    "$$\\hat{N_x} = \\sum_{m_i, s_j \\in R} \\hat{\\omega}_x(m_i, s_j), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\omega}_x(m_i, s_j)$ is the simulated number of events in catalog $x$ in spatial cell $s_j$ and magnitude cell $m_i$, generating a set of simulated rates $\\{ \\hat{N} \\}$. We can then calculate the probability of i) observing at most $N_{obs}$ events and ii) of observing at least $N_{obs}$ events.\n",
    "These probabilities can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_1 =  \\frac{ |\\{ \\hat{N_x} | \\hat{N_x} \\le N_{obs}\\} |}{|\\{ \\hat{N} \\}|}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\\delta_2 =  \\frac{ |\\{ \\hat{N_x} | \\hat{N_x} \\ge N_{obs}\\} |}{|\\{ \\hat{N} \\}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a forecast is Poisson, the expected number of events in the forecast follows a Poisson distribution with expectation $N_{fore} = \\sum_{m_i, s_j \\in R} \\lambda(m_i, s_j)$. The cumulative distribution is then a Poisson cumulative distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x|N_{fore}) = \\exp(-N_{fore}) \\sum^{x}_{i=0} \\frac{(N_{fore})^i}{i!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be used directly without the need for simulations. The N-test quantile score is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_1 =  1 - F((N_{obs}-1)|N_{fore}),$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_2 = F(N_{obs}|N_{fore}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The original N-test considered only $\\delta_2$ and it's complement $1-\\delta_2$, which  effectively tested the probability of at most $N_{obs}$ events and more than $N_{obs}$ events. Very small or very large values (<0.025 or > 0.975 respectively) were considered to be inconsistent with the forecast in Schorlemmer et al (2010). However the approach above aims to test something subtely different, that is at least $N_{obs}$ events and at most $N_{obs}$ events. Zechar et al (2010a) recommends testing both $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ with an effective significance of have the required significance level, so for a required significance level of 0.05, a forecast is consistent if both $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are greater than 0.025. A very small $\\delta_1$ suggest the rate is too low while a very low $\\delta_2$ suggests a rate which is too high to be consistent with observations.\n"

The upper and lower bounds for the test are determined from the cumulative Poisson distribution. `number_test_result.quantile` will return both $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ values."

    "### Forecast comparison tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency tests above check whether a forecast is consistent with observations, but do not provide a straightforward way to compare two different forecasts. A few suggestions for this focus on the information gain of one forecast relative to another (Harte and Vere-Jones 2005, Imoto and Hurukawa, 2006, Imoto and Rhoades, 2010, Rhoades et al 2011). The T-test and W-test implementations for earthquake forecast comparison are first described in Rhoades et al. (2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "The information gain per earthquake (IGPE) of model A compared to model B is defined by  $I_{N}(A, B) = R/N$ where R is the rate-corrected log-likelihood ratio of models A and B gven by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\big{(}\\log\\lambda_A(i_k) - \\log \\lambda_B(i_k)\\big{)} - \\big{(}\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B\\big{)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If we set $X_i=\\log\\lambda_A(k_i)$ and $Y_i=\\log\\lambda_B(k_i)$ then we can define the information gain per earthquake (IGPE) as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_N(A, B) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum^N_{i=1}\\big{(}X_i - Y_i\\big{)} - \\frac{\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $I(A, B)$ differs significantly from 0, the model with the lower likelihood can be rejected in favour of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> t-test </b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "If $X_i - Y_i$ are independent and come from the same normal population with mean $\\mu$ then we can use the classic paired t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis that $\\mu = (\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B)/N$ against the alternative hypothesis $\\mu \\ne (\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B)/N$.\n",
    "To implement this, we let $s$ denote the sample variance of $(X_i - Y_i)$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum^N_{i=1}\\big{(}X_i - Y_i\\big{)}^2 - \\frac{1}{N^2 - N}\\bigg{(}\\sum^N_{i=1}\\big{(}X_i - Y_i\\big{)}\\bigg{)}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis $T = I_N(A, B)\\big{/}\\big{(}s/\\sqrt{N}\\big{)}$ has a t-distribution with $N-1$ degrees of freedom and the null hypothesis can be rejected if $|T|$ exceeds a critical value of the $t_{N-1}$ distribution. The confidence intervals for $\\mu - (\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B)/N$ can then be constructed with the form $I_N(A,B) \\pm ts/\\sqrt{N}$ where t is the appropriate quantile of the $t_{N-1}$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> W-test </b>  \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the t-test is the Wilcoxan signed-rank test or W-test. This is a non-parameteric alternative to the t-test which can be used if we do not feel the assumption of normally distributed differences in $X_i - Y_i$ is valid. This assumption might b particularly poor when we have small sample sizes. The W-test instead depends on the (weaker) assumption that $X_i - Y_i$ is symmetric and tests whether the meadian of $X_i - Y_i$ is equal to $(\\hat{N}_A - \\hat{N}_B)/N$. The W-test is less powerful than the T-test for normally distributed differences and cannot reject the null hypothesis (with $95\\%$ confidence) for very small sample sizes ($N \\leq 5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test becomes more accurate as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ due to the central limit theorem and therefore the t-test is considered dependable for large $N$. Where $N$ is small, a model might only be considered more informative if both the t- and W-test results agree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Implementation in pyCSEP</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test and W-tests are implemented in pyCSEP as below.\n"

    "## Catalog-based forecast tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Catalog-based forecast tests evaluate forecasts using simulated outputs in the form of synthetic earthquake catalogs. Thus, removing the need for the Poisson approximation and simulation procedure used with grid-based forecasts. We know that observed seismicity is overdispersed with respect to a Poissonian model due to spatio-temporal clustering. Overdispersed models are more likely to be rejected by the original Poisson-based CSEP tests (Werner et al, 2011a). This modification of the testing framework allows for a broader range of forecast models. The distribution of realizations is then compared with observations, similar to in the grid-based case.  These tests were developed by Savran et al 2020, who applied them to test forecasts following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake in Southern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following text, we show how catalog-based forecasts are defined. Again we begin by defining a region $\\boldsymbol{R}$ as a function of some magnitude range $\\boldsymbol{M}$, spatial domain $\\boldsymbol{S}$ and time period $\\boldsymbol{T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{M} \\times \\boldsymbol{S} \\times \\boldsymbol{T}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An earthquake $e$ can be described by a magnitude $m_i$ at some location $s_j$ and time $t_k$. A catalog is simply a collection of earthquakes, thus the observed catalog can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega = \\big{\\{}e_n \\big{|} n= 1...N_{obs}; e_n \\in \\boldsymbol{R} \\big{\\}}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and a forecast is then specified as a collection of synthetic catalogs containing events $\\hat{e}_{nj}$ in domain $\\boldsymbol{R}$, as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda} \\equiv \\Lambda_j = \\{\\hat{e}_{nj} | n = 1... N_j, j= 1....J ;\\hat{e}_{nj} \\in \\boldsymbol{R} \\}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, a forecast consists of $J$ simulated catalogs each containing $N_j$ events, described in time, space and magnitude such that $\\hat{e}_{nj}$ describes the $n$th synthetic event in the $j$th synthetic catalog $\\Lambda_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "When using simulated forecasts in pyCSEP, we must first explicitly specify the forecast region by specifying the spatial domain and magnitude regions as below. In effect, these are filters applied to the forecast and observations to retain only the events in $\\boldsymbol{R}$. The examples in this section are catalog-based forecast simulations for the Landers earthquake and aftershock sequence generated using UCERF3-ETAS (Field et al, 2017)."

    "<b>Aim</b>: As above, the number test aims to evaluate if the number of observed events is consistent with the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Method</b>: The observed statistic in this case is given by $N_{obs} = |\\Omega|$, which is simply the number of events in the observed catalog.\n",
    "To build the test distribution from the forecast, we simply count the number of events in each simulated catalog.\n",

    "$$ N_{j} = |\\Lambda_c|; j = 1...J$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the gridded test above, we can then evaluate the probabilities of at least and at most N events, in this case using the empirical cumlative distribution function of $F_N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_1 = P(N_j \\geq N_{obs}) = 1 - F_N(N_{obs}-1)$$ \n",

    "#### <b> Magnitude Test </b>\n",
    "<b>Aim</b>: The magnitude test aims to test the consistency of the observed frequency-magnitude distribution with that in the simulated catalogs that make up the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Method:</b> The catalog-based magnitude test is implemented quite differently to the grid-based equivalent. We first define the union catalog $\\Lambda_U$ as the union of all simulated catalogs in the forecast. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Lambda_U = \\{ \\lambda_1 \\cup \\lambda_2 \\cup ... \\cup \\lambda_j \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that the union catalog contains all events across all simulated catalogs for a total of $N_U = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\big{|}\\lambda_j\\big{|}$ events.  \n",
    "We then compute the following histograms discretised to the magnitude range and magnitude step size (specified earlier for pyCSEP):\n",
    "1. the histogram of the union catalog magnitudes $\\Lambda_U^{(m)}$\n",
    "2. Histograms of magnitudes in each of the individual simulated catalogs $\\lambda_j^{(m)}$\n",
    "3. the histogram of the observed catalog magnitudes $\\Omega^{(m)}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms are normalized so that the total number of events across all bins is equal to the observed number. The observed statistic is then calculated as the sum of squared logarithmic residuals between the normalised observed magnitudes and the union histograms. This statistic is related to the Kramer von-Mises statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{obs}= \\sum_{k}\\Bigg(\\log\\Bigg[\\frac{N_{obs}}{N_U} \\Lambda_U^{(m)}(k) + 1\\Bigg]- \\log\\Big[\\Omega^{(m)}(k) + 1\\Big]\\Bigg)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Lambda_U^{(m)}(k)$ and $\\Omega^{(m)}(k) $ represent the count in the $k$th bin of the magnitude-frequency distribution in the union and observed catalogs respectively. We add unity to each bin to avoid $\\log(0)$. We then build the test distribution from the catalogs in $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_j =  \\sum_{k}\\Bigg(\\log\\Bigg[\\frac{N_{obs}}{N_U} \\Lambda_U^{(m)}(k) + 1\\Bigg]- \\log\\Bigg[\\frac{N_{obs}}{N_j}\\Lambda_j^{(m)}(k) + 1\\Bigg]\\Bigg)^2; j= 1...J$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda_j^{(m)}(k)$ represents the count in the $k$th bin of the magnitude-frequency distribution of the $j$th catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantile score can then be calculated using the empirical CDF such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma_m = F_D(d_{obs})= P(D_j \\leq d_{obs})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Implementation in pyCSEP </b>  \n",
    "Hopefully you now see why it was necessary to specify our magnitude range explicitly when we set up the catalog-type testing - we need to makes sure the magnitudes are properly discretised for the model we want to test."

    "#### <b>Pseudo-likelihood test</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Aim </b>: The pseudo-likelihood test aims to evaluate the likelihood of a forecast given an observed catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Method </b>: The pseudo-likelihood test has similar aims to the grid-based likelihood test above, but its implementation differs in a few significant ways. Firstly, it does not compute an actual likelihood (hence the name pseudo-likelihood), and instead of aggregating over cells as in the grid-based case, the pseudo-likelihood test aggregates likelihood over target event likelihood scores (so likelihood score per target event, rather than likelihood score per grid cell). The most important difference, however, is that the pseudo-likelihood tests do not use a Poisson likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudo-likelihood approach is based on the continuous point process likelihood function. A continuous marked space-time point process can be specified by a conditional intensity function $\\lambda(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t)$, in which $H_t$ describes the history of the process in time. The log-likelihood function for any point process in $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log \\lambda(e_i|H_t) - \\int_{\\boldsymbol{R}}\\lambda(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t)d\\boldsymbol{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all models will have an explicit likelihood function, so instead we approximate the expectation of $\\lambda(e|H_t)$ using the forecast catalogs. The approximate rate density is defined as the conditional expectation given a discretised region $R_d$ of the continuous rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\lambda}(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t) = E\\big[\\lambda(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t)|R_d\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We still regard the model as continuous, but the rate density is approximated within a single cell. This is analogous to the gridded approach where we count the number of events in discrete cells.\n",
    "The pseudo-loglikelihood is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\hat{\\lambda}(e_i|H_t) - \\int_R \\hat{\\lambda}(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t) dR $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can write the approximate rate density as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\lambda}(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t) = \\sum_M \\hat{\\lambda}(\\boldsymbol{e}|H_t), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we take the sum over all magnitude bins $M$. We can calculate observed pseudolikelihood as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{L}_{obs} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{obs}} \\log \\hat{\\lambda}_s(k_i) - \\bar{N}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\lambda}_s(k_i)$ is the approximate rate density in the $k$th spatial cell and $k_i$ denotes the spatil cell in which the $i$th event occurs. $\\bar{N}$ is the expected number of events in $R_d$. Similarly, we calculate the test distribution as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{L}_{j} = \\Bigg[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{j}} \\log\\hat{\\lambda}_s(k_{ij}) - \\bar{N}\\Bigg]; j = 1....J, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\lambda}_s(k_{ij})$ describes the approximate rate density of the $i$th event in the $j$th catalog. We can then calculate the quantile score as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma_L = F_L(\\hat{L}_{obs})= P(\\hat{L}_j \\leq \\hat{L}_{obs}).$$\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Method</b> We perform the spatial test in the catalog-based approach in a similar way to the grid-based spatial test approach: by normalising the approximate rate density. In this case, we use the normalisation $\\hat{\\lambda}_s = \\hat{\\lambda}_s \\big/ \\sum_{R} \\hat{\\lambda}_s$. Then the observed spatial test statistic is calculated as\n",

    "in which $\\hat{\\lambda}_s^*(k_i)$ is the normalised approximate rate density in the $k$th cell corresponding to the $i$th event in the observed catalog $\\Omega$.\n",
    "Similarly, we define the test distribution using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_{c} = \\bigg[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{j}} \\log \\hat{\\lambda}_s^*(k_{ij})\\bigg]N_{j}^{-1}; j= 1...J$$\n",
