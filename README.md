# Description:
The pyCSEP Toolkit helps earthquake forecast model developers evaluate their forecasts with the goal of understanding
earthquake predictability.

pyCSEP should:
1. Help modelers become familiar with formats, procedures, and evaluations used in CSEP Testing Centers.
2. Provide vetted software for model developers to use in their research.
3. Provide quantitative and visual tools to assess earthquake forecast quality.
4. Promote open-science ideas by ensuring transparency and availability of scientific code and results.
5. Curate benchmark models and data sets for modelers to conduct retrospective experiments of their forecasts.

# Installation:
pyCSEP can be installed in several ways. It can be installed using conda or pip package managers or from the 
source code found in the pyCSEP github repo. Researchers interested in contributing to pyCSEP development should 
install pyCSEP from source code. pyCSEP depends on the following software packages. 
These which may be installed automatically, or manually, depending on the installation method used.
* Python 3.7 or later (https://python.org)
* NumPy 1.21.3 or later (https://numpy.org)
* SciPy 1.7.1 or later (https://scipy.org)
* pandas 1.3.4 or later (https://pandas.pydata.org)
* cartopy 0.20.0 or later (https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest)
* GEOS 3.7.2 or later (https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)
* PROJ 8.0.0 or later (https://proj.org/)

Please see the [requirements file](https://github.com/SCECcode/pycsep/blob/master/requirements.yml) for a complete list 
of requirements. These are installed automatically when using the `conda` distribution.

Detailed pyCSEP [installation instructions](https://docs.cseptesting.org/getting_started/installing.html) can be found 
in the online pyCSEP documentation.

# Usage: 
Once installed, pyCSEP methods can be invoked from python code by importing package csep. pyCSEP provides objects and 
utilities related to several key concepts:
* Earthquake Catalogs
* Earthquake Forecasts
* Earthquake Forecast Evaluations
* Regions

An simple example to download and plot an earthquake catalog from the USGS ComCat:
<pre>
import csep
from csep.core import regions
from csep.utils import time_utils
start_time = time_utils.strptime_to_utc_datetime('2019-01-01 00:00:00.0')
end_time = time_utils.utc_now_datetime()
catalog = csep.query_comcat(start_time, end_time)
catalog.plot()
</pre>

Please see [pyCSEP Getting Started](https://docs.cseptesting.org/getting_started/core_concepts) documentation for more examples and tutorials.
